# Mini Message Board

This is the repo for the Mini Message Board in the NodeJS project of The Odin Project.  The purpose of the project is to create a simple message board using NodeJS and Express.

## What I Learned

### Express Generator

I'm all for the Express Generator.  I didn't know this existed until this course.  All this time I had been trying to structure my NodeJS projects all by myself.  I always had the internet to help me piece together my file structure, but using the boilerplate from Express Generator really makes things a lot easier.

### Pug (formerly Jade)

While Pug is not my preferred templating engine, I thought I would expand my horizons and give it a try.  Jumping right into it, I was having trouble figuring out how to put elements together.  Because I used Express Generator with Pug as my templating engine choice, there were some template files created that I could reference and try to gather how the syntax worked.  I tried reading the [Pug documentation](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) but I struggled figuring out where everything I needed was.  I can see how developers prefer a more simplistic syntax, but I guess I'm more traditional and would like to see more HTML syntax.  I missed my angled brackets and tags.
